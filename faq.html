            <div class="faq-card">
                <div class="toggle-btn question">Are you accredited or licensed by educational organizations?</div>
                <div class="answer">There isn’t always a need for licensing or accreditation for online courses.
                    However, some programs do require it. Either way, people will usually ask what type of training
                    or background you have, as well as any licensing that’s available if that’s relevant. Make sure
                    that you answer this question by telling them if you do hold any licenses or accreditation, as
                    well as by explaining whether or not those are needed, and why. It gives them the confidence
                    that you have the right experience and boosts your credibility because you’re offering
                    additional information for the sake of education alone. </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-card">
                <div class="toggle-btn question">Does online learning really work?</div>
                <div class="answer">There are always going to be sceptics, and there are frequently multiple of them
                    when it comes to online learning. Everyone wants to know if taking classes online "really
                    works," but there are a lot of elements to take into account, making it difficult to answer. In
                    general, internet education can be successful. That is contingent upon a number of factors,
                    including the appropriate arrangement of the courses, the expertise and education of the
                    provider, and the student's performance in an online learning environment. People need to know
                    what they're getting into, and you should be able to convey these things to them. After that,
                    you might ask them to get in touch with you to talk about whether it would be suitable for them.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-card">
                <div class="toggle-btn question">What is online learning like?</div>
                <div class="answer">The most common query from those who have never used online learning is what
                    it's really like. You are aware that there are various forms of online learning, thus there is a
                    warning. Thus, this is your opportunity to clarify it to others. Make it clear to them that
                    there are several kinds of online programmes and courses, and they must choose the one that best
                    suits their needs. After that, give them all the information they require by outlining the kinds
                    of courses you provide and the operation of your online programmes. In addition to providing
                    them with facts, this builds their trust because you're being open and honest with them.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-card">
                <div class="toggle-btn question">Can I learn at my own pace?</div>
                <div class="answer">This is yet another typical query regarding online education. Self-paced
                    programmes are frequently offered in addition to conventional classroom or meeting-style
                    programmes. Because there are so many busy people in the world today who desire to improve
                    themselves, self-paced programmes are very popular. Regardless of whether you offer this choice,
                    make sure you respond to this query and outline the advantages and disadvantages of each method
                    of instruction. As an added benefit, you can ask them to get in touch with you to find out more
                    details or to talk through their alternatives.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-card">
                <div class="toggle-btn question">What types of assignments do you give?</div>
                <div class="answer">People frequently want to know what kind of work they'll be doing when they take
                    online classes, much like they want to know the style of online learning. Make sure to include a
                    brief overview of your qualifications here, and if you can, include links to earlier tasks or
                    projects. Links to programme or course pages are also possible. People can make better decisions
                    about their educational needs if you tell them about the coursework expectations and the way the
                    courses are taught.

            </div>

            <div class="faq-card">
                <div class="toggle-btn question">What are the requirements to take the courses or sign up with your
                    website?</div>
                <div class="answer">People will be curious about how to begin. Although you can direct them to the
                    sections of your website that assist them in that process, you should also take the time to
                    explain it to them directly. List any enrollment windows you may have, for example. If there are
                    any requirements for deposits or payment, please clarify. Regardless of the nature of the
                    courses you offer online, make sure customers are aware of all the requirements.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-card">
                <div class="toggle-btn question"> What are the technology requirements?</div>
                <div class="answer">In a same spirit, consumers must ascertain the state of their computers. You
                    should describe all of the software you utilise as well as the sort of equipment required for
                    participants in your online courses. Include any programmes or apps that are utilised in this
                    section. Here, too, you should provide technology if you have it or point them in the direction
                    of the right buy. Assure them that you are available to assist with the needs and that they may
                    get in touch with you to talk about whether their system can support the requirements of your
                    online courses. </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-card">
                <div class="toggle-btn question">How long does each course take?</div>
                <div class="answer">While some online courses span several months, others are only a few hours long.
                    Your courses could have different durations based on the kind of online education you provide.
                    Tell folks about the many kinds of courses you provide and the duration of each one. This is
                    another opportunity to remind customers that you provide self-paced learning and reassure them
                    that you can assist them in studying at their own speed. </div>
